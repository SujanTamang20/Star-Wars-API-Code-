 This web application is designed to interact with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and present information about various aspects of the Star Wars universe. Let's break down each component:

### Features

1. Fetching and Displaying Data: The application retrieves data such as films, starships, planets, and characters from the Star Wars API and presents it in a user-friendly format on the web page.
   
2. User-Friendly Display: The information retrieved from the API is formatted and displayed using HTML and styled with CSS to create a visually appealing and organized layout.
   
3. Error Handling: The application is equipped with error handling mechanisms to manage situations where API requests fail or when no data is available.

### Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styles the HTML elements to enhance the visual presentation.
- JavaScript: Implements the logic to interact with the API and manipulate the webpage dynamically.
- Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive design and pre-styled components.
- Font Awesome: Offers scalable vector icons used for buttons or indicators.
- jQuery: Simplifies JavaScript programming by abstracting commonly used functions.
